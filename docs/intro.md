# What is Kiwi

Kiwi is a decentralized version of HackerNews, focusing exclusively on crypto tech, products, and culture. At Kiwi, a community of crypto veterans shares, upvotes, and discusses top crypto essays, news, art, GitHub repos, and Dune Dashboards.

Kiwi stores links and upvotes on the **[protocol level](/docs/kiwi-how-works/protocol)**. Thanks to that, users can create their own UIs and permissionlessly create apps on top of it.

You can access our app here: **[news.kiwistand.com](https://news.kiwistand.com)**

And learn the story behind the project in this 4 min video by Tim Daubenschutz:
